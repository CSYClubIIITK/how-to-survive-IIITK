# **Things to Do in Cochin: A (Very) Honest Guide** üå¥

Ah, Cochin. Or Kochi. Or Cochin (I'm still not sure). If you're planning a visit to this spicy little slice of Kerala, buckle up because, oh boy, this city is a wild ride. And by wild, I mean laid-back. Imagine sipping coconut water on the beach, and you suddenly hit the edge of attaining enlightenment before a honking tuk-tuk ruins the moment. That is Cochin in a nutshell: a cultural smoothie that hits you with flavors of history, nature, and the occasional existential crisis. If you ever catch yourself wriggling into the question, "What in tarnation am I supposed to do in Cochin?", don‚Äôt worry.

## **1. Get Fisherman's Arm at the Chinese Fishing Nets**

Ever fancied being a fisherman from the 14th century? Of course you have. Well, luck has it that Cochin has these gargantuan, ancient Chinese fishing nets that resemble spider webs on steroids. Locals claim that the Chinese brought them over (likely along with noodles or whatever), and now they've become the most iconic Instagram backdrop for tourists who just want to seem *cultured*. You won't catch any fish, but you will catch a vibe. Bonus points if you pretend to help the fishermen for a photo‚Äîbecause who wouldn't want to look like a reluctant fisherperson?

## **2. Explore Fort Kochi and Try to Imagine a Wes Anderson Movie**

Fort Kochi is like that artsy neighborhood every city has, but with 300% more crumbly colonial buildings and Portuguese charm. You will feel as if you are strolling through an aesthetically beautiful movie montage on narrow streets flanked by street art, quirky cafes, and so many antique shops you'll rethink your IKEA furniture choices. 

**Pro tip**: Wear your most ridiculous hat and don‚Äôt forget to stop off to pay an exorbitant fee to get a coffee. How else are people going to know you are off on a voyage of self-discovery?

## **3. Mattancherry Palace: The Place to Show Off Your (Very Very Short) Historical Knowledge**

Mattancherry Palace is basically Cochin's way of shouting, "Hey, I am old, man, and important!" Also known as the Dutch Palace (for history appears to be as confusing as Cochin‚Äôs name), this place is full of cool murals depicting Hindu epics like the *Ramayana*, which will remind you that your life is much less epic.

It's the kind of place where you stroll around with this nagging feeling that you *should* have known something from it, but all you're really doing is mentally preparing for your next trivia night victory.

## **4. Jew Town: Not What It Sounds Like**

You heard it right: Jew Town. And no, this isn‚Äôt some politically incorrect theme park; it‚Äôs an historic district where the Jewish community of Cochin lived for centuries. These days, it‚Äôs filled with antique shops that'll make you wonder, "That‚Äôs cool, but where in the world would I even put it?"

Walk around and visit the **Paradesi Synagogue**, the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth. It‚Äôs quirky, lovely, and a great conversation starter when you get back home.

## **5. Go on a Kerala Backwaters Tour: The Laid-Back of the Laid-Back**

Okay, for real, Cochin is the gateway to Kerala's famous backwaters, a.k.a. the natural lazy river of your dreams. Imagine: you‚Äôre on a boat, slipping along silky waters, overlooking plush greenery, and wondering if you're having the most peaceful moment of your life.

And yes, until you snap 47 identical pictures of palm trees and realize you‚Äôre running out of storage space.

**Pro tip**: Bring snacks and an existential question to ponder, because you'll have plenty of time for both.

---

## **6. Cherai Beach: It‚Äôs a Beach**

It wouldn‚Äôt be a proper travel guide without a beach, right? **Cherai Beach** is where the Arabian Sea decides to get all up in Kerala‚Äôs business. Is it the best beach in the world? Not really. But it‚Äôs *a* beach, so that‚Äôs something.

You can wade through the waves, construct a sandcastle, or just ponder the infinite mysteries of life as the sun sets dramatically. Just watch out not to step on someone's Instagram photo shoot.

---

## **7. Eat Food That Will Ruin and Bless You All at Once**

Cochin‚Äôs food is legendary. Kerala cuisine will run the gamut of emotions on you: ‚ÄúThis is the best thing I‚Äôve ever tasted‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to spontaneously combust from this spice level.‚Äù Think biryani, appam with stew, and seafood that was probably caught 10 minutes ago. 

**Warning**: Coconut is not just an ingredient here‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle. Just roll with it.

---

## **8. Go on a Spice Tour and Realize You Know Nothing About Cooking**

Cochin is the spice trade capital of the world. Take a spice tour and learn how cinnamon, cardamom, and other spices you‚Äôve only heard of on high-brow cooking shows are grown. Be prepared for that moment when the guide says, ‚ÄúAnd this is where we dry the pepper,‚Äù and you pretend like you didn‚Äôt already know pepper comes in a shaker from the grocery store.

---

## **9. Santa Cruz Basilica: It‚Äôs Big, It‚Äôs Old, It‚Äôs a Church**

Churches? Good? Here‚Äôs **Santa Cruz Basilica**. It‚Äôs the epitome of ‚Äúwow, this is old.‚Äù Built by the Portuguese and full of colorful Gothic architecture, it‚Äôs the kind of place where you stand underneath and think, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt my ceilings look like this?‚Äù 

Also, a great spot to sit quietly and think about how you‚Äôre going to justify your Instagram captions later.

---

## **10. Ernakulam: A Whole Other World**

If you‚Äôre growing tired of Cochin‚Äôs sleepy, historical vibe (as if you ever could), then **Ernakulam** is where you might retreat to. The whole thing is like the commercialized version of Fort Kochi‚Äîthink Cochin‚Äôs cool younger sibling that always tries to be cooler. It‚Äôs the home of shopping malls and chain restaurants, where you can experience Kerala in "modern mode." 

Do you think you‚Äôll miss the artsy quirkiness of Fort Kochi? Probably. But sometimes you just need a little KFC and air conditioning, you know?

---

## **In short...**

Cochin may not be the wildest city in the world, but it has a little something for everyone‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre an armchair historian, foodie, or just someone trying to ‚Äôgram that time you *almost* went fishing. You‚Äôll leave with your stomach full of spices and your heart full of‚Ä¶ well, probably even more spices. Safe travels, and don‚Äôt forget to take a photo with some random cat. It‚Äôs basically a rite of passage here. üêæ
