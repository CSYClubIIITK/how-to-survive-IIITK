# Actually Preparing for Your Mid-Semester Exams and Maybe Not Hating It

`Author - Bavishya`

So it's that time of the semester again. You know, the one where you're hit with the sudden realization that exams are a thing and not just a distant event that happens to other people. Mid-sem exams creep up like an awful plot twist, and here you sit, wondering, "Am I actually ready to cram for these without spiraling into a state of mild madness?" The truth is, probably!

Okay, so first of all, I'm not going to say "get started early" because, let's be real, nobody ever does. If you're reading this, you are beyond the "oh crap" stage of getting ready for exams, so here are some real strategies.

## 1. Work Out What You Need to Know Instead of Guessing

Step one is easy: know what in tarnation you are reading. Now, I know this sounds like obvious advice, but how many times have you opened up a textbook only to spend three hours on something entirely irrelevant to the test? Yeah, it happens. Here's what you actually need to do:

- Check your syllabus (you know, that document you ignored on day one).
- Ask your prof what's important. This can be awkward, but guess what? They want you to do well (probably). Most of the time, they'll give you hints like "Focus on chapters 3 through 5," or "I really like essay questions." Boom, there's your study guide.
- Old exams or quizzes are a goldmine. They're like sneak peeks at the test, minus the spoilers.

## 2. Create a Study Schedule, Even Though You'll Probably Never Stick to It

Everyone keeps saying to create a study schedule and, well, this is for good reason. However, here's the secret: make it flexible enough so you have room for procrastination because fact: you are going to get distracted by at least one Instagram reel.

- Start by making a list of all the topics you need to go over.
- Break them down into reasonable chunks. Don't tell yourself you're reading five chapters in one sitting. We both know that's a load of crap.

Plan out what you're reading each day, but leave room for error. You know you're going to need an extra day when you inevitably waste an afternoon deep-diving into conspiracy theories about flat Earth.

## 3. Use Active Study Techniques (a.k.a. Stop Just Reading Stuff)

Bad news, but just reading isn't studying. Your brain is thinking, "Cool, words," then immediately forgets those words because the attention span can be about as reliable as the Wi-Fi in a crowded coffee shop. So, what can be done instead?

- **Practice testing**: Quiz yourself, use flashcards, or—my personal favorite—try to explain the topic to that cat that roams around campus. If it looks confused, that means you don't actually know the material yet.
- **Summarize stuff**: Pretend you're writing the most boring blog post of your life. Summarizing forces your brain to process the information, which is good because that's kind of the whole point.
- **Teach someone**: If you can teach your study buddy, or again, that cat, then you will likely remember the information. You also get to feel superior for a few minutes, which is always great.

## 4. The Pomodoro Technique: The Hack You Didn't Know You Needed

Chances are, you might have heard of this "Pomodoro Technique" but haven't actually put it to the test yet. Well, here it is in all its glory:

- Set the timer to 25 minutes.
- Focus on studying with no interruptions, distractions.
- Take a five-minute break to scroll through Twitter, YouTube, or existentially stare at your wall.
- Repeat.

This technique is game-changing because it tricks your brain into thinking 25 minutes isn't that long. And guess what? It works! You'll get way more done in 25 focused minutes than in three hours of mindlessly highlighting sentences and wondering why your eyes are burning.

## 5. Sleep is Not the Enemy

This is going to sound radical, but bear with me: sleep is actually beneficial. Yeah, I know—you've been told that all-nighters are the way to go. But newsflash: sleep literally helps your brain process and store information. If you're too tired, you're just going to stare blankly at your notes while drooling slightly, and no one wins in that situation.

So, here's what you should do:

- Power naps are your friend. A 20-minute nap is like a little brain reboot.
- Get a full 7-8 hours if you can. Yes, it's tempting to stay up until 3 a.m., but you'll be a zombie during the test, and zombies are notoriously bad at passing exams.

## 6. Stop Multitasking, You Monster

I know you think you can have it all: watch Netflix, scroll Instagram, and study at the same time. Spoiler: you can't. In fact, research has shown that multitasking makes you worse at everything. Pick one thing at a time. If you are studying, then just study. And if you are watching Netflix, then just binge-watch and accept nothing productive is happening.

Ways to help you be in the zone include:

- Turn the "Do Not Disturb" on your phone on for a reason.
- Use Forest or Focus@Will apps to keep you off your phone or provide non-distracting background music.
- Put your phone in another room because, come on, let's not pretend that won't work either.

## 7. Reward Yourself for Small Wins

Let's just say, no one is a robot. I understand that studying hurts, but it doesn't have to be soul-crushingly painful. Use rewards to bribe yourself into actually getting things done:

- Finish a chapter? Watch one YouTube video.
- Study for an hour? Eat that snack you've been thinking about all day.
- Pass the exam? Maybe buy yourself that overpriced hoodie you've been eyeing.

When you associate learning with small prizes, it isn't all so punitive. It feels like you're playing a game, leveling up each time you learn. You're basically unlocking "Achievements for Study." And who doesn't love achievements?

## 8. Don't Freak Out (But Also, Don't Do Nothing)

Look, mid-sem exams are important, but they're not the end of the world. You've got this. If you've read this far, it means you care at least a little bit about your grades, which is already a solid step in the right direction. The key is balance: study hard, but also don't forget to take breaks, eat actual food (instant noodles don't count), and please shower during exam week.

**Conclusion**: Plan ahead, focus, don't multi-task, and for the love of goodness, sleep. You'll be fine for mid-semester exams, and if you're a diligent student following this guide, you might even emerge from that whole process with a feeling of accomplishment—and less stress-induced acne.
