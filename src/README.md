# How to Survive IIITK

`Author - Ansh (and chatGPT)`

Hello there, weary traveler or adventurous freshman! 🧭

Welcome to **How to Survive IIITK**, the ultimate guide to thriving (or at least surviving) life at IIIT Kottayam! Whether you're a battle-worn senior with some wisdom to impart, or a first-year student still trying to figure out which side of the campus has the best WiFi signal, this is the project for YOU.

**What is this all about?**

This open-source project is your chance to contribute to the collective knowledge bank of IIITK. Think of it as your survival manual — written by the students, for the students! Whether it's those cryptic bus timings, mastering the art of submitting assignments at 11:59 PM, figuring out where to find the _best_ biryani in town (or at least edible food), or knowing the secret spots to chill between classes, this project covers it all. 🤘

**How can you contribute?**

Glad you asked! 🌟

We’re covering EVERYTHING here — **food**, **travel**, **study hacks**, **sports**, **clubs**, **social life**, and **mental health tips** (because college is hard, man!). The more you share, the more others benefit. Let's make life at IIITK a little easier for everyone.
