Before we understand how to reach our college, let's first take a bird's eye view of our college:

I've also highlighted the imporant places around our college. Your travel for the next 4 years will mostly revolve around these 5 places. There's one other place that's missing from the map that I've marked using a red dot and that's Nechipuzhoor.

### Kochi (Cochin) - The Nearest Metro City (~60 km)
Kochi is the nearest metro city, and you can get there by air, rail, or road. From Kochi, you’ll have a couple of options:
- Bus: You can catch a bus to Pala (~2.5 hours, ₹80) or, if you’re lucky, find one heading directly to Valavoor or Nechipuzhoor.
- Buses typically leave from Vytilla Bus Terminal. If you arrive in Kochi by train, you can reach Vytilla via metro. If you’re flying in, you’ll need to take a cab, auto, or bus to Vytilla.
- Cab: If you want to skip the hassle, just book a cab directly from Kochi to the campus. It’ll set you back around ₹2,000 (depending on the time).

### Kottayam - The Nearest City (~30 km)
Kottayam is the nearest city from our college (~30km). You can reach Kottayam via rail and road. From there, you can:
- Bus: Catch a bus to Pala, then switch to another bus for Valavoor or Nechipuzhoor (~1 hour, ₹45). The bus stop is conveniently located near the railway station.
- Cab: If you're not in the mood for multiple buses, you can hop into a cab and get to the campus in about 45 minutes (~₹1,000).

### Pala - The Nearest Town (~10 km)
Pala is your nearest town for shopping and daily needs. Here’s how you can get to campus from Pala:
- Bus: Take a local bus to Nechipuzhoor or Valavoor (~20 minutes, ₹10).
- Auto: If you’re short on time, take an auto straight to the campus (~10 minutes, ₹250).


### Valavoor & Nechipuzhoor - Nearest Bus Stops (~1 km)
Valavoor and Nechipuzhoor are the closest bus stops to the college. Once you get there, you can either:
- Walk the 1 km uphill to the campus, or
- Take an auto waiting near the bus stand for a quick ride.

### Enjoy the Journey!

We know this sounds like a lot to digest, but don’t worry — you'll get the hang of it soon enough. The first trip to campus is a memorable one. Especially if you're traveling from Kottayam to Pala, you'll be treated to some stunning scenery — forests, hills, and all the lush greenery Kerala is famous for!

Safe travels, and see you at the campus!
